	ACTIVE TEMPLATE LIBRARY : CopyUncPath Project Overview
========================================================================

AppWizard has created this CopyUncPath project for you to use as the starting point for
writing your Dynamic Link Library (DLL).

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your project.

CopyUncPath.vcxproj
	This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard.
	It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and
	information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
	Application Wizard.

CopyUncPath.vcxproj.filters
	This is the filters file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
	It contains information about the association between the files in your project 
	and the filters. This association is used in the IDE to show grouping of files with
	similar extensions under a specific node (for e.g. ".cpp" files are associated with the
	"Source Files" filter).

CopyUncPath.idl
	This file contains the IDL definitions of the type library, the interfaces
	and co-classes defined in your project.
	This file will be processed by the MIDL compiler to generate:
		C++ interface definitions and GUID declarations (CopyUncPath.h)
		GUID definitions                                (CopyUncPath_i.c)
		A type library                                  (CopyUncPath.tlb)
		Marshaling code                                 (CopyUncPath_p.c and dlldata.c)

CopyUncPath.h
	This file contains the C++ interface definitions and GUID declarations of the
	items defined in CopyUncPath.idl. It will be regenerated by MIDL during compilation.

CopyUncPath.cpp
	This file contains the object map and the implementation of your DLL's exports.

CopyUncPath.rc
	This is a listing of all of the Microsoft Windows resources that the
	program uses.

CopyUncPath.def
	This module-definition file provides the linker with information about the exports
	required by your DLL. It contains exports for:
		DllGetClassObject
		DllCanUnloadNow
		DllRegisterServer
		DllUnregisterServer
		DllInstall

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
	These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
	named CopyUncPath.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.

Resource.h
	This is the standard header file that defines resource IDs.
